\section{Data Preprocessing}
\subsection{Processing the Data Containing Null Values and Assigning Labels}[3]
It had been seen that the data set contained null values in Height, Weight and Age features. In order to remove, the missing values they were replaced by the whole feature's mean with the help of Simple Imputer library.Then by using label encoder library I labeled the Family history overweight,Fav,Smoke,Scc and Nobesity. I also labeled Calc,Caec,Mtrans and Gender with label encoder . The look of the data set is as follows:
\vspace{-6mm}

\caption{Look of the dataset after data pre processing.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}
\section{Clustering}
\subsection{K-Means}[1][2]
The K-MEANS clustering was done with features Height and Weight. I chose these because to see how Weight is distributed according to Height. It shows that most of the points are closer to cluster center. The clusters are well defined. It shows that how the people according to their height are distributed with their weight. In order to find the cluster centers it was done through the elbow method in order to find out the optimum number of cluster centers. The reason I used the elbow method because it is hard to find the number of cluster points which is hyper parameter by hit and trial method. Also if we run with out the elbow method K-means clustering it will take time by increasing the number of clusters one by one. It is also computationally efficient in terms as it quickly defines the desired clusters. Also defines clusters in a well defined way meaning showing how they look.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Weight and Height in KMEANS clustering.png}
\caption{Clusters with n = 3 between Height and Weight feature of the from data set.} \label{fig1}

\end{figure}
According to the above figure people in cluster 1 have  between 40kg and 70kg with height range from 1.5m to 1.9m this means that these are normal weight people. Then according to cluster 2 have height of 1.5m to 1.7m with weight range from 70kg to 100kg this means that these are medium weight people. Then in the third cluster people have height 1.55m to 1.9m and weight 100kg to 160kg, this shows that they are obese people.
\subsection{DB Scan}[4][2]
Then DB-Scan clustering was done between the 
Weight and Ncp,Weight and Caec,Weight and Calc.Also the 
clusters are well defined.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{CaeC AND WEIGHT IN DBSCAN.png}
\caption{Cluster generated between Weight and CAEC feature of the from data set.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}
The below image is of Weight and Caec and it shows that most of the people consumes food 2 times between meals per day have weight between 40kg to 155kg.Followed by people consuming food 1 time between meals per day have weight between 40kg to 120kg. Then people consuming food 0 times between meals per day have weight between 50kg and 125kg. Then people consuming food 3 times between meals per day have weight between 40kg and 120kg and these people are less in quantity.
\vspace{-10mm}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Weight and NCP in DB scan.png}
\caption{Cluster generated between Weight and NCP feature of the from data set.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}
The above figure shows that overall people range from weight from 40kg to 160kg with taking meals per day 1 to taking 4 meals per day. The most densely populated area are of those people that have weight between 40kg to 160kgs that consumes meals per day from 1 to 3 meals per day.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{calc AND WEIGHT IN DBSCAN.png}
\caption{Cluster generated between Weight and CALC feature of the from data set.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}
The above image shows that most of the poeple are part of that area who consumes alcohol 2 times of on daily basis and have weight ranging from 40kg to 130 kgs. Followed by those people who consume alcohol 3 times have weight ranging from 40kg to 110kg. Then a few people consume alcohol 1 time per day have weight between 40kg to 117kg.Last there is only 1 person who does not consume alcohol and have weight a little bit over 60kg.
After increasing the radius (eps) to 25 and number of points in 
neighbourhood to 100 the outliers were more visible from the 
cluster during DBSCAN as can be shown in above two images. The 
radius and number of point in neighbour hood are the hyper 
parameters of the clustering algorithm. The 
reason I used DBScan because it identifies the points that are 
outliers robustly and gives their visibility in a more dominant 
way. Then the next reason is that it gives a visibility of the 
clusters based on how densely are the points in the clusters are 
populated based on the radius of defining the which tells 
neighbour hood and the number inside the neighbourhood which helps
the upcoming points position to be established and in which 
cluster they belongs.
\subsection{Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering}[4][2]
Then Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering was done by Weight and Faf. The reason I consider Weight and Faf is to show how many people according to their Weight do physical activities. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{faf AND WEIGHT IN HIERARCHIAL CLUSTERING.png}
\caption{Cluster generated between Weight and FAF feature of the from data set.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}
It showed in the above image that in cluster 1 people that weigh between 40kg to 75kg and do physically activity between 0 to 3 times. Then people in cluster 4 weigh between 75kg to 95 kg who physical activity between 0 to 3 times. Followed by cluster 3 which shows people weighing between 95 to 125 do physical activity between 0 to 2 times a day. Lastly cluster 2 has least number of people who are overweight and do physical activity 0 to 3 times a day. The reason I used this type of clustering is to understand that what is the similarity between FAF and Weight meaning how they are related to each other. The next thing was the hyper parameters of this type of clustering is not too hard to measure which is distance the between the clusters.

\section{Regression}
\subsection{Understanding the Co-relation between the Features}[5]
The first thing that was to find out the correlation between the features
that had positive relationship with each other these were
Age,Height,Gender,Weight,
Family history overweight, Caec and Faf. 
The feature that were positively co related with Nobesity were
Age, Height, Weight and Overweight. The positive relationship means that the features are directly proportional with each other. Below we can see the relationship between features through heat map.
\vspace{-8mm}
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=13cm,height=10cm]{Heat map for the regression.png}
\caption{Heat Map telling about positive and negative correlation between the features} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Execution of Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm}[5][6]
I divided my dataset into seventy five percent of train set and twenty five percent of test set.
After running first linear regression algorithm on the 
features that were Age,Height,Gender,Weight,Family history
overweight, Caec 
and Faf
with the final predicted value to be 
Nobesity,
the root mean squared error and mean
squared error values  are as follow: 
Root Mean Square Error is 1.6803561547748596 and
Mean Square Error is 1.427363464522431
It shows that the predicted values(Nobesity values) of the model and actual 
value(Nobesity value) the difference between them were minimal.
Then after this I used another regression algorithm but this time using Age, Height, 
Weight and Overweight because the above mentioned features had a positive 
relationship with Nobesity feature and the final predicted value to be 
Nobesity. After running the second regression algorithm 
the root mean square error is 1.703936572943416 and the mean absolute is
1.460638798474195.It shows that the RMSE and MAE of first linear regression model is less than the second linear regression model so it means that  Age, Height, Weight , Gender,Family history with overweight, Caec and Faf.This means that if a person has high weight, has family history of overweight, high consumption of food between meals,more age and did little or none physical activity will be more likely to be overweight. The reason I used multiple linear regression is because to find out how relationship between the dependent variable (Nobesity) and the independent variable Age,Height,Gender,Weight,Family history 
overweight, 
Caec and Faf is and this can be shown in the above description that is showing calculation of root mean square error and mean absolute error.

\section{Classification}
\vspace{-30mm}
\subsection{Finding best hyper parameters for KNN Algorithm}
\vspace{-35mm}
[7]
I divided my dataset into seventy five percent of train set and twenty five percent of test set.
The classification algorithm that was used was K 
Nearest Neighbour Classifier so in order to use it,
its hyper parameters needs to be find that are best to
on overall data set. So by using Grid Search 
CV it is showed that the best hyper parameter values 
are n neighbours = 1 and p = 1. p = 1 is the distance meaning Minkowsi distance is being used for determining the distance between new features point and class feature point.The hyper 
parameter were selected based on these features: ( 
Age , Height, Gender,Weight,Family history with 
overweight,Caec and Faf) that had a positive 
relationship with each other through heat map. The reason I used KNN algorithm is to find out when new data entry of the person comes based on the given parameters then to which obesity level will it be classified then.
\vspace{73mm}
\subsection{Executing the Nearest Neighbour Classifier}
\begin{figure}[H]
\hspace*{0cm}\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Classification report}
\caption{Classification report of the classification model according to data inputs} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}[6][7]
According to classification report as shown above, after executing the classification model,the model was able to achieve the 0.88 accuracy which is 
a good accuracy pointing out that the model classified correctly the people's obesity level. Also it gave good
precision,recall,f1-score and support which were 
also good as well. The reason I used classification algorithm as to identify how people fall under the Obesity levels given in Nobesity feature based on the on the features like Age, Gender, Weight, Family history with overweight, Caec and Faf.

\section{Frequent Pattern Mining}
\subsection{Ideas to do Frequent Patterning Mining On Obesity Data Set}
[9][10]First thing that can be done is to first group the 
Nobesity feature with Age, Weight,Gender,Family 
history overweight,Faf,Ncp,Calc,Caec and Ch20. Then 
we can apply Apriori algorithm in order to find out 
which frequent itemsets are made. The generation of 
frequent item sets will be based on the minimum 
support that is the threshold. Another reason for 
using Apriori algorithm is that association rule 
mining requires frequent item sets in order to make 
association rules. Next we can apply association 
rule mining to further clarify so that it can be 
shown that through which features can a person be 
considered obese. This clarification can be provided 
by applying metric which is lift. Lift is basically 
it tells how correlated is the antecedent and 
consequent in the association rule.If the lift is 
high it means that the features which are related to 
eating habits have strong correlation with Nobesity 
which is the corresponds to obesity level and the 
features related to eating habits that have week 
correlation with the Nobesity containing obesity 
levels will have a low lift. The decision which 
association rule is useful or not is based on if 
that association rule's lift is greater than 1 then 
it has strong co-relation, if it is less than 1 then 
it has weak co-relation and if it is near to 1 then 
there is no co-relation. The reason is that we can 
see what patterns are made based on the eating 
habits.
Then next thing that can be done for further better 
analysis is to group the Nobesity feature with 
Age,Gender,Height,Weight and related fields based on physical condition like Scc and Faf. Identify the frequent itemsets again through Apriori algorithm and then find association rules that have strong corelation. The 
reason is that we can see what patterns are made 
based on the physical conditions.Lastly after getting the association rules from 
eating habits and from physical conditions we can 
identify those association rules which can be 
considered by combining both the eating habits 
features and the physical condition features to find out which association rules have strong correlation. Through frequent pattern mining we can also find new co relations between the features in the data and a result we can increasing the precision and accuracy in clustering, classification and regression.[8]
